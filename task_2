//polymorphism

The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming 
it refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

polymorphism is taken from the Greek words Poly (many) and morphism (forms). 
It means that the same function name can be used for different types. 
This makes programming more intuitive and easier.

//Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in OOP. 
It describes the idea of restricting access to methods and attributes in a class. 
This will hide the complex details from the users, and prevent data being modified by accident. 
In Python, this is achieved by using private methods or attributes using underscore as prefix, i.e. single “_” or double “__”.

describes the concept of bundling data and methods within a single unit.

//data abstraction

The process by which data and functions are defined in such a way that only essential details
can be seen and unnecessary implementations are hidden is called Data Abstraction.

example: tv to watch shows ,movie,etc..
